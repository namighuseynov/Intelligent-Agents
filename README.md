# Intelligent-Agents
The "Intelligent Agents" project explores various decision-making strategies implemented within virtual agents in the Unity game engine. The project encompasses a diverse range of agent types, each with distinct decision-making paradigms.

## Overview
This project explores various decision-making strategies implemented within virtual agents in the Unity game engine. The project encompasses a diverse range of agent types, each with distinct decision-making paradigms, including primitive agents, intelligent agents, multi-agent systems, and intelligent multi-agent systems with game theory.

## Features
- **Primitive Agents:** Agents adhere to pre-scripted behaviors, relying on simple rules and conditions for decision-making.
- **Intelligent Agents:** Agents utilize game theory concepts to make decisions, aiming to optimize outcomes in dynamic environments.
- **Multi-Agent Systems:** Agents interact with one another, forming cooperative or competitive relationships, with strategies adapting based on the actions of other agents.
- **Intelligent Multi-Agent Systems with Game Theory:** Agents dynamically adjust their strategies in response to the strategies employed by other agents, exploring various cooperative and adversarial scenarios.

- ## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Unity project in the Unity Editor.
3. Explore the various scenes and scripts to understand the implementation of different agent types and decision-making strategies.
4. Playtest and experiment with the agents to observe their behavior and interactions.
